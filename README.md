# ADP Project 3: Vending Machine

- Author: P. Chong, ADP Student @ RED Academy 2018 Q3

## Description and Objective:

- The objective for this project is to create a vending machine in Javascript. A test-driven development(TDD) approach should be taken and 10 well-formed and passing tests should be created.
- The vending machine does not require a UI

## Questions and Learnings

- TDD Approach to Development
  - In this week of classes we discussed the benefits of writing tests first and then writing code. TDD promotes the consideration of functionality and edge-cases. ie. What exactly do we want our code to achieve? By having a better idea of what we want, the code we write is cleaner.
  - TDD allows for greater maintainability of code as it becomes more complex. By having a pre-established set of tests that can be run between changes, we can be confident that the code still works if the tests still pass (provided, we have written good tests!)

## Using:

- Javascript
- Jest for testing

## Set Up

1. Download the repo
1. Run npm install
1. Run npx jest
